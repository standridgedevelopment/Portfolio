				<div class="p mb-4">Hello! My name is Isaiah Standridge! I am a tenor, soon-to-be father, and aspiring software developer. I am quick-learning, adaptable, and steady. </div>
				<p>In highschool I began work as a busser. I trained as a server and continued to support myself through College. I eventually worked my way up to my most recent position as a Service Manager. </p>
				<p>As a service manager, I was responsible for overseeing and managing the schedule, the training, and service standards of 50+ employees. </p>
				<p>I also have a strong sales background as well. I was a sales agent at Geico for two years. I found huge success there and spent my time as a top sales agent.</p>				 
				<p>As a soon-to-be father, I have decided on a new career path. I left my management career and joined the Eleven Fifty Academy. At Eleven Fifty Academy, I've already become proficient C# and SQL databases. I've also had a strong focus on HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</p>

				<h4 class="my-4">Local Sprits MVC!</h4>
				<p>My final project for Eleven Fifty Academy. This a full-stack MVC website deployed to Microsoft Azure. </p>
				<p>This is a site for finding local events at nearby breweries, wineries, distilleries, and bars. Some features include: Personal profiles, Calendars for cities and businesses, Friend's List, Activity Feed, Reviews, Comments, and Likes. </p>
				<p>This project went far above and beyond the scope of the assignment. I learned so much about C#, Entity Framework, ASP.NET, HTML, CSS, and Javascript/Ajax for this project.</p>

				<h4 class="my-4">Trail AID API!</h4>
				<p>Another one of my major projects at Eleven Fifty Academy to create an API using C#, Entity Framework, and SQL. This was a group project to create our own API from the ground up. This project involved two other team members. </p>
				<p>I took on the role of team lead for this project. I wrote our development schedule and assigned the work in addition to programming the most complex aspects of this API. I'm very proud of how this project turned out. </p>

				<h4 class="my-4">Trail AID Front-End!</h4>
				<p>This was not a requirment for our API project. I wanted to take what I learned from building my Star Wars API front-end and apply it to my own API.</p>
				<p>This app not only needed the ability to pull information, but also add and edit content as well. This was a huge challenge, but it turned out very well!</p>

				<h4 class="my-4">Star Wars API Front-End!</h4>
				<p>Star Wars API or SWAPI is a great tool. I learned so much as I began exploring the API. I decided to create my own Front-End for SWAPI.</p>

			<h4 class="my-4">CSS Creature Project!</h4>
			<p>My very first html/css project as a part of Eleven Fifty Academy! We were assigned to create some creature only using html and css! I decided to add some animation. </p>

			<h4 class="my-4">RPG Project!</h4>
			<p>My favorite accomplishment so far! We were assigned to create some small playable console game. We were given one and a half days of class to accomplish this. I decided to create my own turn-based RPG.</p>
			<p>I created two playable hero classes, a generic hench-men to fight and a boss battle. The game featured a fully functioning skill system and small story to play through.</p>
			<p>I have continued to refine the game since it was turned in. It now features consumable items, loot from enemies, status effects(poison for now), unlockable skills, enemy skills, and a new enemy with a poison skill.</p>

			<h4 class="my-4">Math Challenge!</h4>
			<p>The project that stated it all for me. I started learning c# a month before my Software Development course began at Eleven Fifty Academy.</p>
			<p>This Math Program is the result of my home studies. It is common to create a basic calculator app when learning a language, but I wanted to do more.</p>
			<p>This small console game lets you select between addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, or a mix. But it also has unlockable difficulty levels.</p>
